A (wrapping) Snake game using the accelerometer for the Adafruit's PyBadge written in TinyGo

"Proof of Concept" ;) was done during the SCaLE18x session, 3/8/2020, with Mike(? sorry, uncertain of his name) - using the "snake" code, and borrowing the accelerometer code from "step7".

Todd later refactored much of the code.
